Greetings, my name is Sheick Wattara and this project is my Recipe Website Project. A website of hand picked favorite recipes with webpages for 3 different dishes.

As you browse through this project, my goal is to display my abilities to show the following skills
-Create a basic HTML document
-Link webpages to create a website
-Add and size images with alt web accesibility
-Create both an unordered and order list

The website is simple and plain to show the basic undestanding of a HTML document.

Thank you for takin your time to browse through this website and hope you try your hand at a new recipe!
